# me133a_final
Repo for ME133a "Make Atlas do Pullups" + etc.

Implemented:

- Atlas does pullups using his arms only (not the back joints)
- Pull-up bar created by second node with GUI for pan/tilt
             
TODO

- Create subscriber in trajectory node to read bar orientation
- Match atlas pelvis orientation to bar pan
- Alter altas hand trajectory based on bar tilt (to 'keep hands on bar')
             
What to additionally implement?? Keeping feet fixed? Foot motion relative to hands?
